# Dotfiles

Tools backup.

## Todos

- Fix symlinks:
  - Link whole folders instead of each single file inside a directory
- Update dotobot:
  - Remove submodle and add dotbot via homebrew
- Make different configs:
  - One private setup and one job setup
  - Also differentiate between private and job git e-mail addresses (no private
    mails in work git repository commits)
